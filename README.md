# RDFJS Representation Task Force

The RDFJS Representation Task Force is a focus group of the [RDFJS Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/).
We strive to design interface specifications so different JavaScript implementations of RDF concepts can interoperate.

This repository contains documents created by the Representation Task Force:
